## History

It originally started in 2006 as Synergos on SourceForge by ASK-Solutions licensed under the GPL v3 license. Due to circumstances it had to be removed from SourceForge and moved to our private servers; the source code remained available to anyone upon request. Around February 2019 we renamed the project to Nocterra, removed the WYSIWYG web based interface, the dependence upon MySQL, the blog and webshop. These will be reintroduced as extensions.

## Installing/Upgrading

**NOTE** The source code is currently [available upon request](mailto://info@ask-solutions.org). We will however commit the code here on GitHub as soon as we have updated the documentation and have a committable version of the code.

## Support

We will setup new support channels when the code has been re-released to the public.

## License

Nocterra is released under GPLv3.
We strive to not using any libraries from other projects but if necessary those libraries will be re-released under their original license.
